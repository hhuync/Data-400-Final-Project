## Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted labor markets worldwide, particularly within technology-driven roles. This project examines how **Data Scientist job postings in the United States** changed before and after COVID, using job descriptions as a lens to understand shifting employer expectations.

By comparing **pre-COVID (2018–2019)** and **post-COVID (2022–2025)** job postings, this project analyzes changes in:
- Required skills and tools
- Language used in job descriptions
- Role specialization and structure
- Emergence of AI and generative AI terminology

The goal is to understand whether COVID led to fundamental changes in data roles or accelerated existing trends.

---

## Research Questions

- How did Data Scientist job descriptions change after COVID?
- Which technical skills remained stable across time?
- Which new skills or technologies gained prominence post-COVID?
- How did the structure and specialization of job postings evolve?

---

## Data Sources

This project uses two datasets:

1. **Jobspikr Data Scientist Job Postings (2018–2019)**  
   - U.S.-based Data Scientist job postings  
   - Used to represent the pre-COVID labor market

2. **Google Search Job Postings (2022–2025)**  
   - Aggregated job postings collected via Google Search  
   - Used to represent the post-COVID labor market

Both datasets are provided as CSV files and must be placed in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.

---

## Data Description

The primary dataset used for analysis, `job_postings_clean.csv`, is **generated programmatically by the Jupyter Notebook** during the data cleaning and preprocessing stage. This cleaned dataset combines and standardizes job postings from both source datasets into a single analysis-ready table.

Each row represents a **single Data Scientist job posting**. The cleaned dataset includes postings from two time periods:
- **Pre-COVID (2018–2019)** job postings from Jobspikr
- **Post-COVID (2022–2025)** job postings collected via Google Search

Key variables in the cleaned dataset include:
- `date`: Job posting date
- `year`: Year extracted from posting date
- `period`: Indicator for pre-COVID or post-COVID period
- `title`: Job title
- `description`: Full job description text
- `company`: Employer name
- `location_raw`: Original free-text job location
- `state_norm`: Standardized U.S. state abbreviation (best-effort)
- `region`: U.S. Census-style region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West, or Remote)
- `is_remote`: Indicator for remote job postings
- `role_group`: Categorized role type based on job title
- Keyword indicators and counts (e.g., `ai_word`, `genai_any`, `python_any`)

During preprocessing, job postings without valid dates were removed, text fields were cleaned, and postings were filtered to **Data Scientist roles only** for comparability. To reduce geographic bias, a matched sample was created based on region and remote status, resulting in equal-sized pre- and post-COVID samples used in the main analysis.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Standardization
- Standardized column names across datasets
- Parsed posting dates, job titles, locations, and descriptions
- Removed postings without valid dates
- Focused on **Data Scientist roles only** for comparability

### Matching for Comparability
To ensure a fair comparison between periods:
- Job postings were matched by **U.S. region** (Northeast, Midwest, South, West)
- Remote postings were treated as a separate category
- Final matched sample includes an equal number of pre- and post-COVID postings

### Analysis Techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Keyword frequency analysis
- Word clouds for qualitative comparison
- TF-IDF + KMeans clustering (k = 3)
- Simple linear regression controlling for region and remote status
- Trend analysis within post-COVID postings (2022–2025)

---

## Exploratory Analysis

Exploratory analysis focused on:
- Posting frequency patterns over time
- Geographic distribution of job postings
- Common keywords in job descriptions

Visualizations such as time-series plots, bar charts, and word clouds were used to identify initial patterns and guide further analysis.


---

## Key Findings

- **Core data skills** such as Python and SQL remained consistently important across both periods
- **AI-related language increased significantly** after COVID
- **Generative AI terminology** appears almost exclusively in post-COVID job descriptions
- Job descriptions became **more specialized and diverse** after COVID
- Clustering results suggest a broader range of Data Scientist role types in the post-COVID period

## Installation & Setup

This project was developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

Required packages include:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- wordcloud

All dependencies can be installed by running the first cell of the Jupyter Notebook.

---

## Limitations

- Data sources differ in collection methodology
- Geographic information is extracted from free-text location fields
- The project compares pre- and post-COVID periods but does not include postings from 2020–2021
- Results are descriptive and exploratory rather than causal

---

## Conclusion

This project shows that while foundational data skills remained stable across the COVID divide, the post-COVID labor market reflects increased specialization and a growing emphasis on AI and generative AI technologies. Job postings provide valuable insight into how external shocks reshape technical roles and employer expectations over time.
